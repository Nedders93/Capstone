# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

Here is the Capstone Project I completed as the final part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

Project scenario:

In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
